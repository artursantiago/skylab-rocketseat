# Skylab Rocketseat

A Skylab clone with only html and css.

I did my best to make the clone look like the original page, but there are still some alignment errors.

For a while, I still tried to fix these problems, but I came to the conclusion that trying to fix them is just **I N S A N E**.

Besides, also there are some css properties that I needed to know to animated some buttons that I didn't know that exist haha... T-T.
